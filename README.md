Important developer notes: 
Create new branches for every change. 
Do not commit into master
Always Create a Merge Request when branch is ready

We use something called Maven, we do not have a main() for our app
to use build the project run `mvn clean install`
later to test the rest api we will use `mvn run:jetty`
